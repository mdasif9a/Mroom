                </ul>

            </p><p>
                Disclaimers related to completeness and authenticity of the content / listings
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The user should conduct checks and establish authenticity of any property, or project, its title, built up area, suitability for buying / renting in a form and manner deemed appropriate at his or her cost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mroom.in being an advertising platform does not and cannot validate the authenticity of content in its Services. A lot of content is uploaded by the advertiser and we do not filter or verify the same. If a complaint is made, we will take remedial measures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Certain points to bear in mind:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Conduct a comprehensive check of ownership to verify owners' / landlords’ credentials.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Visit the project site/property personally, to ensure that the seller’s / landlord’s claim is genuine and that the property is not an 'imaginary' one.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Beware of false title documents. Loans may have been secured against properties that may be disputed or have remained vacant for long.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We strongly recommend that proper due diligence on the property is conducted prior to entering into a transaction related to a real estate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It should be independently ensured by the User whether the seller is complying with the provisions of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016 and its applicability to the relevant property or project.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
