            </ul>

            <p>Our goal in this policy is to be completely transparent about the data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it, in order to make finding your new home a pleasant and fun experience!</p>

            <h2>To Whom Does This Policy Apply</h2>
            <p>Some parts of this Policy are directed at specific types of people. We use some special terminology to refer to them, which we define below. This Policy applies to everyone who uses our Services, but sometimes we direct parts of it toward particular groups of users.</p>
            <p><strong>Users:</strong> "Users" are everyone who uses our Services.</p>
            <p><strong>Real Estate Professionals (REPs):</strong> "Real Estate Professionals," or "REPs" are users who have created accounts (free or paid) with us to sell or rent real estate, participate in our advertising services, and participate in other Services that we direct toward the professional real estate community. REPs include landlords, agents, developers, institutional property consultants, mortgage professionals, and subscribers. We send leads to REPs on your behalf, as described in this Policy.</p>

            <h2>What Information Do We Collect, and Where Do We Get It</h2>
            <p>We collect some information from all visitors to our website. Like many online services, we use technologies like session and persistent cookies, web beacons (tiny image files on web pages that communicate information about the page viewer to the beacon owner), log data, and third-party analytics services to collect and analyze information about all users of our Services. This includes things like User search preferences, interaction with ads on our Website, and location.</p>
            <p>Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile number, your mobile carrier, your email address, device, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications. We use Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them, as well as collect and use them in the aggregate. This Policy does not apply to, nor do we take any responsibility for, any information that is collected by any third party either using the Website or through any links on the Website or through any of the advertisements.</p>
            <p>We collect some personal information like name, contact details, mobile number, email address, profile images/photos/pictures which you have provided us during the account creation/registration process or while interacting with any of our services to ensure a smoother user experience and to tailor our services to your preferences and interests.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that we transfer to your computer. We use "session" cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Services, to better understand how you interact with our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic information on our Services. We use "persistent" cookies to recognize you each time you return to our Services. For example, we create a persistent cookie that includes some basic information about you, like your most recent search and whether an agent responded to a query you sent using Mroom.in Services. We use this persistent cookie to remember your preferences and, if you create an account, to make your user experience consistent after you register.</p>
            <p>Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings or use third-party tools to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit. You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have. Please be aware that some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect from REPs</h2>
            <p>If you create a REP account with us, whether as a landlord, agent, developer, or subscriber, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to set up your account. We ask all REPs to provide a name, a company (if available), a phone number, and an email address. If you create a paid REP account and become a subscriber, we require you to submit all of the information required from landlords and agents as well as a description of your campaign. We will also collect financial data like credit card information and billing addresses from subscribers, so that we can handle billing. If you are a subscriber, a Mroom.in representative may call you to verify your information.</p>

            <h2>Additional Information About You that We Obtain from Third Parties</h2>
            <p>We may sometimes obtain information about you from third parties and use it to help agents serve you better. For example, our partners may help us provide predictions of your income range and how likely you may be to purchase a home. We will share this augmented data only with selected REPs (subscribers) who you choose to share information with by contacting them through the Mroom.in Services.</p>

            <h2>Location Data</h2>
            <p>If you provide location information (like a ZIP code, street address, or even just a city) during the registration process or at any other time via your account settings, we will store that information and associate it with your account. We may use and store information about your location to provide localized features, to analyze our Services with the help of third-party analytics services, to provide you with relevant advertising and marketing materials, and otherwise to improve and customize our Services.</p>
            <p>If you do not want us to share your information with other companies or organizations, please let us know by emailing us at support@Mroom.in. In case you wish to delete your information from our website, please let us know by emailing us at support@Mroom.in.</p>
